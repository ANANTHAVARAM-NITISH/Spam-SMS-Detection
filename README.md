Spam SMS Detection is a machine learning project designed to classify SMS messages as either spam or ham (not spam). 
It uses a dataset of labeled messages and applies text processing techniques to convert them into a numerical format using TF-IDF vectorization. 
The project implements different machine learning models, including Na√Øve Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Logistic Regression, to identify spam messages based on patterns in the text. 
The best-performing model is selected based on accuracy.
This project utilizes pandas for data handling and preprocessing, scikit-learn for machine learning model training and evaluation, and TfidfVectorizer for feature extraction by converting text into numerical representations.
